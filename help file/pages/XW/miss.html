The Mission tab is rather simple and straight-forward. The first setting controls which animation you see after you fail a mission by turning your fighter in several smaller pieces.<br><br>
The IFFs section changes the names and behaviour towards the player. The names have a limit of 12 characters and are used for Goal strings in-game.  Check the box if the ships are to be regarded as enemies, leave it unchecked for friendlies.<br><br>
The End Of Mission Messages should be self-explanatory. They show up when a goal group is declared passed or failed.
