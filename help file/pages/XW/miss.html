The Mission tab is rather simple and straight-forward. There'a time limit and then a couple settings for the location, death outcome and Death Star settings.<br><br>
The Mission Complete Messages are different in that all three are for Mission Complete only, and will display in sequence.<br><br>
The Randomizer value (formerly Unk1) is supposed to act as a random generator seed for backdrops, however is never used.
