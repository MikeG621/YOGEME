There are three version of X-wing; the original DOS on floppies, the original CD version and the Windows 95 CD version.  XW95 is the most popular and the most likely version you'll run across, so that's what YOGEME is designed to handle.  There are differences between the versions, so something that works on one may not work on another.<br><br>
Since X-wing support was added well after the other platforms, isn't flown as often as the others and is a much simpler misison format, this section of the help file is written with the assumption that you're familiar with mission editing in general. You'll notice that the editor layout is rather sparse, simply because TIE was the first platform to really offer a ton of control.<br><br>
