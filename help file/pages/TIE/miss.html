<p>The Mission tab is rather simple and straight-forward. The first setting controls which animation you see after you fail a mission by turning your fighter in several smaller pieces.</p>

<p>The IFFs section changes the names and behaviour towards the player. The names have a limit of 12 characters and are used for Goal strings in-game.  Check the box if the ships are to be regarded as enemies, leave it unchecked for friendlies.</p>

<p>The End Of Mission Messages should be self-explanatory. They show up when a goal group is declared passed or failed. The color for those messages can be selected as well.</p>

<p>The <i>Random Seed</i> has minimal impact in TIE, usually around asteroid creation and various things like the the exact direction a craft starts evading. This is just an initial value.<br/>
The <i>Time Limit</i> values mostly play into the Training track, haven't looked into if it can affect normal missions.</p>
