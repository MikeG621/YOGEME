<p>The Mission tab sets a couple of other overall settings.  The large text boxes at the top (when available) are the mission texts for before and after the missions.</p>

<p>Below that is the Mission Type, which normally will be "Training".  Set a time limit for the mission if you wish, and below that is the option to toggle the mission between XvT and BoP.</p>

<p>Unsure if <i>WinType</i> has a real effect. <i>Goals unimportant</i> prevents the mission from ending based on goals, useful for melees where you want to keep earning points. The <i>randomizer</i> value helps init backdrops and asteroids if you want to fiddle with that. It's imperitive that this value is the same for all players if engaging in multiplayer.</p>
