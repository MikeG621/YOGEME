The Mission tab sets a couple of other overall settings.  The large text boxes at the top (when available) are the mission texts for before and after the missions.<br><br>
Below that is the Mission Type, which normally will be "Training".  Set a time limit for the mission if you wish, and below that is the option to toggle the mission between XvT and BoP.<br><br>
There's some Unknown values that you can play with as well here.
