The Mission tab sets a couple of other overall settings.  The large text boxes at the top (when available) are the mission texts for before and after the missions.<br><br>
Below that is the Mission Type, which normally will be "Training".  Set a time limit for the mission if you wish, and below that is the option to toggle the mission between XvT and BoP.<br><br>
There's some Unknown values that you can play with as well here, a couple of which have now been uncovered.<br><br>
Former unknowns 0x28 and 0x50 (Unknown4 and 5 in the mission format specs) are part of the BoP IFF names added in 1.7. The former 0x65 (Unk6) is now "Prevent Mission Outcome", which prevents the mission from ending based on goals.
