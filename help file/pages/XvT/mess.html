Like the FlightGroup tab, Messages features a large multiselect-capable list box that displays all of the in-flight messages in their respective colors. There's a maximum of <u>64 messages</u> enforced to prevent file corruption.<br><br>
There's not a whole lot to this, you have a message string limited to <u>64 characters</u>, a short note string similar to the TIE95 FlightGroup.Pilot (LA missions sometimes use this note for who is speaking) and the color that the message will appear as.<br><br>

You have four triggers at your disposal, and although the copy and paste buttons aren't there, you can still use the buttons on the toolbar or the mouse. The <i>Delay</i> works as expected and is the number of seconds after the trigger is fired that the message is sent.<br><br>
Because XvT can be multiplayer, you can also define which teams will see the message.  Just use Team 1 for normal missions.
