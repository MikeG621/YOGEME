This is a central location to modify <u>mission-specific</u> hook settings created by <a href="https://github.com/JeremyAnsel/xwa_hooks">Jérémy Ansel (JeremyaFr)</a>. This will not touch overall or craft-specific hooks, but can adjust things like the Hangar, Flightgroup settings, etc. The mission must be saved (i.e., not named "NewMission") prior to using the dialog.<br><br>

The hooks supported here are Backdrops, Mission_Tie, Engine_Sound, Mission_Objects, Hangars, 32bpp (Skins), S-foils, and Shield.<br><br>

YOGEME can read from "[Mission].ini" as well as the individual "[Mission]_*.txt" files, but will only write out to [Mission].tie and will delete the old .txt files as necessary. Again, this is mission only, so even if a hook supports something like Flightmodels\[Model].ini to globally replace an OPT, this will not touch those, just the Mission portion. When the dialog comes up, the "Use *" checkboxes will be enabled if the appropriate hook DLL has been detected. It will first search for the individual ".txt" files and load the configs from there. Then if it finds "[Mission].ini" it will load that.<br><br>

Please refer to the hook-specific readme sections for the functionalty of each particular setting.  YOGEME will enforce the minimum of 4 HangarMap entries that are required for the hook, but there's no other error-checking to speak of. Use the "Add" and "Remove" buttons to build out the settings you wish to save. If the "Use" checkbox is unchecked, or checked when the list is empty, then upon selecting "OK" any current settings will be removed from "[Mission].ini" if present. Default values will not be written to file.
