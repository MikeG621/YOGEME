<p align=center><img src="../../images/XWA/hooks.png"></p>
<p>This is a central location to modify <u>mission-specific</u> hook settings created by <a href="https://github.com/JeremyAnsel/xwa_hooks">Jérémy Ansel (JeremyaFr)</a>. This will not touch overall or craft-specific hooks, but can adjust things like the Hangar, Flightgroup settings, etc. The mission must be saved (i.e., not named "NewMission") prior to using the dialog.</p>

<p>The hooks supported here are Backdrops, Mission_Tie, Engine_Sound, Mission_Objects, Hangars, SFoils, 32bpp (Skins), Shield, Hyperspace, Concourse, and HullIcon.</p>

<p>YOGEME can read from "[Mission].ini" as well as the individual "[Mission]_*.txt" files, and for the Hangar hook will also detect "[Mission]_[Section]_[OPT].txt" and "[Mission]_[Section]_[OPT]_[IFF#].txt", but will only write out to [Mission].tie and will delete the old .txt files as necessary. Again, this is mission only, so even if a hook supports something like Flightmodels\[Model].ini to globally replace an OPT, this will not touch those, just the Mission portion. In v1.15, the original tabs were replaced with a drop-down selector with a "*" denoting if a hook DLL was not detected, although it will not prevent you from using it. It will first search for the individual ".txt" files and load the configs from there. Then if it finds "[Mission].ini" it will load that.</p>

<p>Please refer to the hook-specific readme sections for the functionalty of each particular setting. YOGEME will enforce the minimum of 4 HangarMap entries that are required for the hook, but there's no other major error-checking to speak of. Click in the text box to see the configuration of the current output. Modifications made in the text box will propagate back into the controls. Default values will not be written to file in most cases.</p>
