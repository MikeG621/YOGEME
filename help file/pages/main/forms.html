<p>Each formation is shown from all three sides with TIE Interceptors so you can understand its orientation. The text panel in the upper right changes providing platform-specific details.</p>

<p>XW and TIE have less formations than XvT and XWA, so while the dialog is the same for all, you will have fewer options. Some formations are a little different between platforms, and this will be reflected per the original values as well as the changes when adjusting FormationSpacing. The crosshairs are the origin of the formation definition, and unchecking the "Center formation" box will instead center the panel around that point.</p>

<p>The formations are all numbered up to six so you can see how they're added in as you increase the number of craft.  As the text panel states, formations are only defined up to 6 craft.  Beyond that, it overflows into later values, which will either be the next formation or junk data.  You can overflow up to 12 here so you can inspect the results.</p>

Selecting <i>OK</i> will choose that formation and update the FlightGroup-Craft tab<br>
