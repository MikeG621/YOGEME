The Map Dialog is the visual interface of placing FlightGroup Waypoints.  From here start locations, flight paths and the briefing locations can be viewed and moved. This is one of the few resizable windows in YOGEME, it can also be maximized for better viewing.<br><br>

By default, only the first Start Point will be visible when you open the map. Additional waypoints can be set in the <a href="opt.html">Options Dialog</a> as defaults.  Craft are color-coded according to their IFF and wireframes are shown at their correct size/orientation unless it would be too small and it falls below a threshold that can also be set in the Options dialog. Another option can set small craft below a certain size to also display as icons instead of wireframe.  Additional colors are used on larger models for meshes designated as Hangars (white) or Docking/Landing Platforms (yellow) with an example below.<br>

The initial view will be <i>X-Y</i> top view, the upper right will allow you to view from the "side" and "front" of the mission space.  Use the checkboxes on the right-hand side to show/hide additional waypoints. Selecting the <i>BRF</i> waypoint (not available in XWA) will hide all others. The disabled checkboxes will activate according to platform. If the view is too cluttered, you can select a Flightgroup on the left to hide it, or left-click the icon/wireframe (or box select) and select it in the popup.<br>

To move around the map, right-click and drag.  The mouse wheel will zoom the map in and out in addition to the slider. Middle-click will reset the map to default location (0, 0) and zoom (40). Click and drag an icon/WP to move it. The coordinates of your mouse pointer updates as you move over the map.<BR>
Hit the "Help" button for more control details, as well as the usage of the filters to show/hide Flightgroups.<BR>

The image above shows the Traces ability. This will connect all enabled WPs. Solid lines connect <i>SP1</i> to the waypoints, and a dashed line connects the last WP used to the <i>HYP</i> point. Unselecting the <i>Tags</i> or <i>Distance</i> checkboxes hide the words near icons and waypoints.
