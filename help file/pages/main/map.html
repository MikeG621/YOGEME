The Map Dialog is the visual interface of placing FlightGroup Waypoints.  From here start locations, flight paths and the briefing locations can be viewed and moved. This is one of the few resizable windows in YOGEME, it can also be maximized for better viewing.<br><br>

By default, only the first Start Point will be visible when you open the map. Additional waypoints can be set in the <a href="opt.html">Options Dialog</a> as defaults.  Craft are color-coded according to their IFF (or gray for XWA and not in the selected Region) and wireframes are shown at their correct size/orientation unless it would be too small and it falls below a threshold that can also be set in the Options dialog. Another option can set small craft below a certain size to also display as icons instead of wireframe.  Additional colors are used on larger models for meshes designated as Hangars (white) or Docking/Landing Platforms (yellow) with an example below.<br>

The initial view will be <i>X-Y</i> top view, the upper right will allow you to view from the "side" and "front" of the mission space.  Use the checkboxes on the right-hand side to show/hide additional waypoints. Selecting the <i>BRF</i> waypoint (not available in XWA) will hide all others. The disabled checkboxes will activate according to platform. If the view is too cluttered, you can select a Flightgroup on the left to hide it, or left-click the icon/wireframe (or box select) and select it in the popup. Use the Hidden '+' button or the 'H' key to hide it, which will remove it form the view and add a flag in the craft list. The Faded '+' or 'F' key will fade the wireframe instead or removing it completely. When a hidden/faded craft is selected (use the craft list if hidden), using the '-' button will restore it, or the 'None' button will restore all in the appropriate category, while the 'S' key will show all.<br>

To move around the map, right-click and drag.  The mouse wheel will zoom the map in and out in addition to the slider. Middle-click actions can be customized in the Options Dialog. Select and L-click drag a Flightgroup/WP to move it (Shift key no longer needed as of v1.8).  If multiple craft are selected, the entire selection will be moved. The coordinates of your mouse pointer updates as you move over the map. There's snap options in the upper right that can control how the drag operations behave.<BR><br>

The images below show the Traces ability. This will connect all enabled WPs. Solid lines connect <i>SP1</i> to the waypoints, and a dashed line connects the last WP used to the <i>HYP</i> point. Unselecting the <i>Tags</i>, <i>Distance</i> and <i>Time</i> checkboxes hide the words near icons and waypoints, with the <i>Hide on fade</i> and <i>Selected only</i> checkboxes helping limit clutter on busy maps. When a craft is Faded, the wireframe and WPs will remain present but grayed out.<br>
