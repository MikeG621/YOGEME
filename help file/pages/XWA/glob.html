<p>This tab is fairly straight forward and defines the global goals for each team. Four goals for each category, standard trigger rules apply, including the toolbar and mouse controls for Copy and Paste functionality.</p>

<p>Unlike TIE, points can be added/subtracted from each set of goals, as well as each individual trigger. Custom goal strings for each applicable goal state can be set as well.  Also avaiable are the additional Active Sequence and parameter fields. There are also a collection of Unknowns if you want to poke around.</p>

<p>As was the case in previous platforms, ensure that when using single goals it's set to "OR FALSE" or "AND TRUE", as many times I've seen this been set to "AND FALSE" which basically means the goal will never complete, and you'll never finish the mission. YOGEME defaults to "OR FALSE" so you shouldn't have to worry about it.</p>
