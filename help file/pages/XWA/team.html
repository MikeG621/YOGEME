The Team tab sets the team names, allegiance and end of mission messages.  The selected team for the Team and Globals tabs are linked.<br><br>
Not much to explain here.  XWA adds a "Neutral" allegiance, which previously was a combination of the other two.  The extra text boxes are note fields, originally used as the name of the person speaking and directions for the voice actors but otherwise don't have any effect on the mission itself.<br><br>
The Name is limited to 17 char, EoM Messages to 64 char, the VoiceID to 20 char, and the Note to 100 char.<br><br>
There's some Unknown values that you can play with as well here.<br>
