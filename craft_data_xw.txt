; Line format is: CraftName,Abbrev,SpeedMGLT,ResourceName
; Empty lines, leading or trailing spaces are ignored.
; Use '#' or '*' (without quotes) to autoreplace with slot numbers, or '-' for a completely blank entry.
; CraftName and Abbrev are only used if Override is enabled in Settings. Resources are always used in the map.
; X-wing is a special case and has two lists. One for the craft names, and another for the wireframe resources,
; hence the second list further down. It needs this because the map converts craft types from XW to TIE.
